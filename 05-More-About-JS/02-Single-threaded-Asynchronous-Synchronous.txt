1  What does Single-threaded mean?


Single-threaded means JavaScript can execute only one task at a time on the Call Stack.

Single-threaded মানে JavaScript একসাথে একটাই কাজ করতে পারে।

🖍️ JavaScript itself is single-threaded, but the browser provides Web APIs that help handle async tasks.


2 What is Synchronous code?
Synchronous code runs line by line, blocking the next task until the current one finishes.

🖍️ Problem with Synchronous code?
Long synchronous tasks can block the Call Stack and freeze the UI.

4 What is Asynchronous code?
Asynchronous code allows long tasks to run in the background without blocking the main thread.

📌 Example:
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async");
}, 1000);

console.log("Sync");
📌 Output:
            Sync
            Async
