1️⃣ What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows two software systems to communicate with each other.

In simple terms:
Frontend → API → Backend → Database
An API is the path used to send and receive data.

Example:
A weather app uses an API to get weather data from a server.

2️⃣ What are the HTTP methods supported by REST?

English:
REST APIs commonly use the following HTTP methods:

GET → Read data

POST → Create new data

PUT → Update full data

PATCH → Update partial data

DELETE → Remove data

3️⃣ Can you use a GET request instead of PUT to create a resource?

❌ No, you should not use GET to create a resource.

Reason:

GET is only for fetching data

POST or PUT is used for creating or updating data

Using GET to create data breaks REST principles

👉 POST is used to create resources.


4️⃣ What is the difference between PUT and POST?

PUT	POST
Updates existing data	Creates new data
Resource ID is known	ID is auto-generated
Same request gives same result	Each request creates new data

Example:

PUT /users/5 → Update user with ID 5

POST /users → Create a new user

5️⃣ What is JSON?


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to exchange data between client and server.

Example:

{
  "name": "Sujon",
  "age": 22,
  "role": "Developer"
}


✔ Lightweight
✔ Easy to read
✔ Most used in APIs



6️⃣ What are CRUD operations?


CRUD represents the four basic database operations:

CRUD	HTTP Method
Create	POST
Read	GET
Update	PUT / PATCH
Delete	DELETE

7️⃣ What is the file extension of JSON?

The file extension of JSON is .json.

8️⃣ What are the data types supported by JSON?

JSON supports the following data types:

String – "name": "Sujon"

Number – "age": 22

Boolean – "isStudent": true

Null – "phone": null

Object – { "city": "Dhaka" }

Array – [ "HTML", "CSS", "JS" ]


9️⃣ What is the role of JSON.stringify()?

JSON.stringify() converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string so it can be sent to a server.

Example:

const user = { name: "Sujon", age: 22 };
JSON.stringify(user);

JSON.stringify() JavaScript object কে JSON string এ convert করে, যাতে server এ পাঠানো যায়।

🔟 Show how to parse a JSON.

To convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object, we use JSON.parse().

Example:

const jsonData = '{"name":"Sujon","age":22}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonData);

JSON string কে JavaScript object বানাতে JSON.parse() ব্যবহার করা হয়।

1️⃣1️⃣ Tell us the difference between GET and POST

English:

GET              -     	POST
Used to fetch data -	Used to send data
Data sent in URL -	Data sent in body
Less secure -	More secure
Can be cached	- Cannot be cached
